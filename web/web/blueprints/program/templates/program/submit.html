<h3>Downloading your Program</h3>
<p>To get a copy of your program, git clone from your team's git endpoint:
<!-- Server admin: if this shows localhost:5000, make sure you're passing
the Host header (not the X-Forwarded-Host, as Werkzeug since v0.15 seems
to not pick this up correctly) through to the application. -->
<code>git clone {{ git_url }} &lt;destination&gt;</code></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can
    <a href="{{ url_for('program.tar') }}">download a tarball</a>
of your code. Note, however, that you will still need a git repository set up
to submit your code.</p>

<h3>Submitting/Uploading your Program</h3>
<p>To submit your program, simply run <code>git push</code> from within your
repository, entering your email and password as prompted. You may create and
push as many branches as you wish, and other members of your team will be able
to download them and check them out. However, scoring will always be run
against your <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<h3>Caching your Password</h3>
<p>You may wish to have your username and password cached so you don't have to
type it every time. In the repository, running
<code>git config credential.helper cache</code> will cause the username and
password to be cached, for 900 seconds (15 minutes) by default. To increase the
amount of time, pass a time in seconds another argument (e.g.
<code>git config credential.helper cache 3600</code> will cache your
credentials for one hour). For more information, see
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_avoiding_repetition">Git's
documentation on storing credentials</a>.</p>
